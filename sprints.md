## Sprint 2: Reliability & Fallbacks
**Duration:** Days 8-10 (3 days)  
**Goal:** Add Puppeteer scraping fallback and anti-bot measures

### Sprint Goals
- Implement Puppeteer scraping adapter as final fallback
- Add Cloudflare bypass capabilities
- Implement circuit breaker pattern
- Add Redis caching layer
- Build robust retry mechanisms

### User Stories
- **US-008**: As a system, I want automatic fallbacks when APIs fail
- **US-009**: As a service, I want to handle Cloudflare protection gracefully
- **US-010**: As a user, I want fast responses through intelligent caching
- **US-011**: As an operator, I want the system to self-heal from failures

### Technical Tasks
- [ ] Implement Puppeteer scraper adapter
- [ ] Add puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth for bot detection bypass
- [ ] Integrate 2Captcha/CapSolver for Turnstile challenges
- [ ] Implement proxy rotation for scraping
- [ ] Add circuit breaker pattern for failing adapters
- [ ] Set up Redis for response caching (30-minute TTL)
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff retry logic
- [ ] Add adapter health monitoring
- [ ] Create fallback chain orchestration
- [ ] Write end-to-end tests for all adapters
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging for debugging

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Puppeteer adapter successfully bypasses Cloudflare
- [ ] Circuit breaker prevents cascade failures
- [ ] Cache hit rate > 70% for repeated requests
- [ ] All adapters have 3x retry with exponential backoff
- [ ] End-to-end tests cover happy path and failures
- [ ] Scraper handles captcha challenges automatically

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **StockX API Access Approval** - Apply immediately, have RapidAPI backup ready
2. **Cloudflare Changes** - Monitor scraper success rates, maintain plugin updates
3. **Legal/ToS Compliance** - Prioritize official API, limit scraping frequency
4. **Performance Under Load** - Early load testing, optimize database queries

### Contingency Plans
- **API Rejection**: Proceed with RapidAPI + scraping approach
- **Captcha Evolution**: Budget for premium captcha service upgrade
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement intelligent request queuing
- **Database Performance**: Add read replicas, implement caching
