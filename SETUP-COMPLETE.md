# 🎉 RetailRadar Setup Complete!

## ✅ What's Been Done

### 1. **Updated README.md** 
- Added comprehensive step-by-step setup instructions
- Included both Docker and local development options
- Added troubleshooting section
- Documented API endpoints and expected responses

### 2. **Simplified Codebase**
- **Focused on Puppeteer functionality only** - commented out unfinished database/API code
- Created simplified versions of key files:
  - `src/index-simple.ts` - Minimal Express server with Puppeteer endpoint
  - `src/config/logger-simple.ts` - Basic console logging
  - `src/utils/CaptchaService-simple.ts` - Placeholder captcha service (deactivated)
  - `tsconfig-simple.json` - TypeScript config for minimal build

### 3. **Fixed Build Process**
- ✅ `npm run build:simple` - Compiles successfully
- ✅ `npm run start` - Runs compiled application  
- ✅ `npm run dev:simple` - Development mode with hot reload
- ✅ Docker build works with updated Dockerfile

### 4. **Working API Endpoints**
- `GET /healthz` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /api/supreme/products` - Supreme products below retail (Puppeteer scraping)

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### Option 1: Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev:simple
```

### Option 2: Production Build
```bash
npm run build:simple
npm run start
```

### Option 3: Docker (Recommended for Production)
```bash
# Simple setup (scraper only)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml up --build

# Full stack with database
docker-compose up --build
```

## 📊 Test the API

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/healthz

# Get Supreme products below retail
curl http://localhost:3000/api/supreme/products
```

## 🔧 What's Working

1. **PuppeteerAdapter** - Scrapes StockX Supreme products using actual selectors
2. **Docker Setup** - Uses official Puppeteer image with proper Chromium support
3. **Price Estimation** - Estimates retail prices based on product categories
4. **JSON Response** - Returns data in the exact format you requested:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Supreme Nike NBA Wristbands (Pack Of 2) Black",
     "belowRetail": "26.67%",
     "retail": "$30",
     "current": "$22",
     "link": "https://stockx.com/supreme-nike-nba-wristbands-red"
   }
   ```

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional)

When you're ready to expand the functionality:

1. **Database Integration** - Uncomment and fix database-related code
2. **Full API** - Restore the complete API endpoints
3. **Caching** - Enable Redis caching
4. **Authentication** - Add API key authentication
5. **Rate Limiting** - Implement request rate limiting

## 📁 Key Files

- `README.md` - Complete setup instructions
- `src/index-simple.ts` - Main application (simplified)
- `src/adapters/PuppeteerAdapter.ts` - Web scraping logic
- `test-build.sh` - Build verification script
- `docker-compose.yml` - Full stack deployment

## 🎉 You're Ready to Go!

The application is now simplified, builds successfully, and focuses purely on the Puppeteer scraping functionality you requested. All unfinished code has been commented out or replaced with working alternatives.

Run `./test-build.sh` anytime to verify everything is working correctly!
